# Climate-change-over-50-years
Part of my personal research work <br>
Tech stack used: Scala, Apache Spark, ScalaFX, SwiftVis2 <br>
Only common stations over the years have been considered for results <br>
Dataset considered: 1968-73 and 2017-22 <br> <br>
Results: <br>
Increase vs Decrease in Max Temp in 50 years <br>
Observation: North America included, other regions shows increase in Max Temp cap <br>
World is getting more hotter <br> <br>

<br> <br>
Increase vs Decrease in Min Temp in 50 years <br>
Observation: North America included, other regions shows increase in Max Temp cap <br>
World is getting hotter <br> <br>

<br> <br>
Diurnal Temp ref: Diurnal temperature range reflects the temperature variation and is defined as the difference between max and min temperatures. <br>
Observation: The gap between max and min temperature is increasing, hence hot is getting hotter and cold more cooler <br> <br>
